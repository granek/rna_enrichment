# rRNA Depletion

## Mapping of H99 mitochondrial rRNA


### Fred's suggestions about mito rRNA annotation

1. Look for conserved region of mitochondrial rRNA (should be low points in spacer regions)
    - BLASTing MT large rRNA produces >95% coverage with Hannaella oryzae and Tremella fuciformis
    - BLASTing MT small rRNA produces ~81% coverage with Hannaella oryzae and Tremella fuciformis

2. Look into spikeyness of MT rRNA read coverage by checking coverage of other genes
    - nuclear rRNA
    - mt COX1
    - tubulin



## Comparison of rRNA depletion methods: polyA, RiboZero, RNaseH
1. Depletion efficiency
2. replication of Total
    1. compare total vs totaltechnical replicates
    - account for non-coding RNA besides rRNA in comparisons with Total RNA
