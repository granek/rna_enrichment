# TODO
1. Use RSamtools to count reads mapping to rRNA genes
2. Calculate "total_reads" as sum of "second_strand" column
3. Calculate "strand mapped reads" as sum of "second_strand" column minus "unmapped" reads from that column
4. calculate rRNA_reads/total_reads and rRNA_reads/strand_mapped_reads for each of the 2018 Total libraries
